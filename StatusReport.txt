Both parts of the exercise have been completed. They both compile and appear to work correctly. I tested both circuits with several inputs: ones that assume correct but also incorrect input. In my design I made sure that any accidental signals are covered by resetting the initial state of the state machine. I used k-maps to make sure that parts of my design perform as intended.

The controller1 circuit works fine and was tested in this way.

The controller2 circuit works fine and was tested in this way.

I have to add comments to code.
